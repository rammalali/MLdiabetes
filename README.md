### Predicting Diabetes with Machine Learning
  Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects a large number of people worldwide. 
  It is a condition that arises when the body is unable to produce or use insulin effectively, 
  resulting in elevated blood sugar levels. 
  This project aims to develop machine learning model to predict if a patient has Diabetes 
  or doesn’t, based on Glucose level, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, etc...
    **Methodology**: \ 
        To create a good model, we propose the following methodology: \
            • Data Collection and visualization: a medical record from patients with or 
            without diabetes has been found on Kaggle.com, we will visualize these 
            data using various techniques such as histogram and heatmaps.

            • Feature Selection: We will select features from the dataset.\
            • Model Selection: We will select appropriate algorithms for our machine 
            learning model, based on the type of data we have.\
            • Model Evaluation: We will assess the accuracy of our model using 
            various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall. We will 
            compare the performance of different models and select the best 
            performing model.\
